# Entrepreneur Research
-----
## Introduction/Background:
We would like to assist entrepreneurs in identifying potential locations and businesses by comparing the top five statesâ€™ dataset 
based on individual case requirements. This is a high level analysis, national and state level, which may lead them to conduct more 
granular level research, county and city level, before coming to a decision. 

## Scope
We will analyze datasets within the past 5-10 years to answer questions below:
* What is the current U.S. population on national and state level?
* What is the demographic for all the states?
  1) Gender
  2) Race
  3) Mean Household Income
  4) Education
* What is the crime rate for all the states?
* What type of businesses are in each state?
