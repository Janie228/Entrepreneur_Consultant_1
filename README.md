# Entrepreneur Potential Business & Location Research

## Introduction/Background:
We would like to assist entrepreneurs identify potential locations for potential businesses by comparing the top five states’ dataset based on individual case requirements. This is a highlevel analysis, national and state level, which may lead them to conduct more granular level
research, county and city level, before coming to a decision. 

## Scope
We will analyze datasets within the past 5-10 years to answer questions below:
• What is the current U.S. population on national and state level?
• What is the demographic for all the states?
  >Gender
  >Race
  >Mean Household Income
  >Education
• What is the crime rate for all the states?
• What type of businesses are in each state?
